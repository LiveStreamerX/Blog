# Blog
Here is the code from my blog
I show How to do different Things on my blog - things I have learnt to do on my data science journey and I display the code from it here. <br> <br>

I mainly use Python (and pandas module)
You can learn how to deal with missing values, duplicate values, perform basic statistics, choose particular columns or rows in your DataFrame.
